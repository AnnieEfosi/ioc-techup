        "\n",
        "This notebook has been written to support the IOC Techup-Women Module, 7A.2 Advanced Python. As we work through the module, we'll alternate between slides and this resource. \n",
        "\n",
        "<br/>\n",
        "\n",
        "We do this as programming is a practical activity. It's best to learn by doing, and by running examples at your own pace, in your own time. This approach will help you get the most out of the learning material.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before you continue, I’m assuming that you've already followed the following code academy tutorial.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "<br/>\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll try and build on what you’ve learned. We'll repeat some ideas that you’ve likely already come across and introduce others that will be unfamiliar. \n",
        "\n",
        "<br/>\n",
        "\n",
        "This resource is supposed to be used in conjunction with the slides made available for **Part 4** of Module 7A.2.\n",

        "## What is Google Colab?\n",
        "Google Colab provides a software environment you can use to execute code. This means you don't have to setup any complicated software environments for yourself - you can simply load this site and run our activities. You'll need your own Google ID to login and use this resource to its full potential. So please, sign up for a Google account if you **do not** already have one. \n",
        "\n",
        "Some of the cells below contain videos that you should watch if unfamiliar with the topics covered. If the cell seems empty (you can't see a video), hover your mouse over the cell. A play button should appear. Click that play button, and then the video should fill the cell. The eagle eyes amongst you might realise that inside these cells I'm using Python to embed some HTML code. This loads the video directly from YouTube. But you don't need to worry about those details.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Using This Resource\n",
        "1. Login to the Colab using a Google account or create one.\n",
        "2. Next we need to create **your** own copy of this resource. That way you can edit it any way you please. To do this, head up the **\"File\"** menu at the top of the screen. Click the **\"File\"** menu.\n",
        "3. Next, click the option that says **\"Download .ipynb\"**. This will download the resource to your own personal computer.\n",
        "4. Now rename the downloaded file so that you know what it is - for example, *\"my activities.ipynb\"*. Remember to keep the file extension **\".ipynb\"** in the file name.\n",
        "5. Now we upload our renamed file to the Colab environment. To do this, click the **\"File\"** menu, then **\"Upload Notebook\"**.\n",
        "Use the file chooser that appears, to select the file you renamed.\n",
        "6. The notebook should load into your browser window. This is now **your** notebook. Any changes you make to it, will not affect anybody else. Please feel free to modify it as you wish.\n",
        "7. The notebook is made up of cells. To run the code inside the cells, we must **\"execute\"** these cells. This is easy to do. Simply hover your mouse over the left most end of a cell containing code. A small **\"play\"** button will appear. Click this play button to execute the code. \n",
        "\n",
        "<br/>\n",
        "\n",
        "I advise that you step through each cell in this notebook slowly, at your own pace. Once you understand each cell, move on. This is important as each cell builds upon the next. Industry activities are provided near the end of the notebook. Enjoy!\n",
        "\n",
        "<br/>\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember, each cell is supposed to be executed in turn from the top to the bottom of this notebook. So, keep that in mind!\n",
